Hello there!

This is my highway project, it's basically just a pcb business card with nfc and some nice text and image.

I did this project because I've wanted to learn the basics of making PCBs, but I didn't really know where to start, but this seemed like a fun place, since it's somewhat simple and has multiple different parts. There's text, images, components and traces on the card. And it's also useful and not just some random PCB that I'd never actually use and would just sit in a drawer.
