PRE-ASSEMBLY TIME 6 HOURS

3.7, 4 hours

I started working on the card, almost completed now. Watched a lot of videos on designing PCBS, read articles and followed hackclub hackcard guide. 
It's going well so far and almost complete, just need to check traces and add some nice text and stuff.

4.7, 2 hours

Project design now complete and now it's just awaiting parts ordering and assembly. I'd predict assembly as a first time solderer could take even 4 hours or so.
Really waiting on the parts and excited to actually see my design and card in person.
